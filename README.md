I want to state this loudly and clearly, this isn't open source so that you can run your own copy.
You can if you want, but some files have deliberately been excluded from the source code to make it harder.

Why? So it's not an easy setup to make a mall bot.
Sure, the risk is basically non-existent and I'm being weird. But I also don't see a real need to encourage people to spin up their own copies of this..

This does do server hits.

This is more of a "how it works" and "changes could be made here"
The aim of this is more on how we're processing the data, not how we got the data.
As such, I don't think we need more things doing the same.

As such, do not ask for support.
If you do however have a need, contact Irrat on discord.
